  "description": "Exports game and account information to image and text files which can be used in OBS and other streaming software.\nSome update in real-time because they reflect your game's current state (eg. active\ncharacter's name, specialisation) while others update every 5 minutes as they reflect non-sensitive data from your\noverall account (eg. wallet coins, PvP/WvW rank).\nLegendary Insights, Legendary Divinations and Unstable Fractal Essences are exported from your www.killproof.me profile. Complementary pre-cropped static icons are provided for your convenience.\nThe default output folder can be located with the dropdown menu of the cogwheel button in the top-right corner when viewing the module's settings.",
