Stats can be:\n- wallet currencies (gold, karma, volatile magic, fractal relics, wvw skirmish tickets, ...)\n- deaths, PvP wins/losses, PvP and WvW kill/death-ratios, ...\n- achievements (killed players in PvP/WvW, captured WvW towers, killed dolyaks, ...).\nWARNING: The data is read from the official GW2 API with your API key and is therefore delayed. Expect delays of at least 5 minutes.",
